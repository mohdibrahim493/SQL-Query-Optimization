# SQL-Query-Optimization

# SQL query flow
The SELECT clause lists the data items to be retrieved by the SELECT statement. The
items may be columns from the database, or columns to be calculated by SQL as it
Performs the query.

The FROM clause lists the tables and views that contain the data to be retrieved by
the query.

The WHERE clause tells SQL to include only certain rows of data in the query results.
The GROUP BY clause specifies a summary query.

The HAVING clause tells SQL to include only certain groups produced by the GROUP
BY clause in the query results. Like the WHERE clause, it uses a search condition to
Specify the desired groups.

The ORDER BY clause sorts the query results based on the data in one or more columns.
If it is omitted, the query results are not sorted.

The result of a SQL query is always a table of data.

# QUERY EXECUTION STEPS
SQL processes the query by going through the table named in the FROM
clause, one row at a time. For each row, SQL takes the values of the columns requested in
the select list and produces a single row of query results. The query results thus contain one
row of data for each row in the table.

SELECT CITY, REGION, (SALES - TARGET)
FROM OFFICES;

To process the query, SQL goes through the offices, generating one row of query results
for each row of the OFFICES table. The first two columns of query
results come directly from the OFFICES table. The third column of query results is
calculated, row by row, using the data values from the current row of the OFFICES table.
SELECT DISTINCT MGR
FROM OFFICES;
Conceptually, SQL carries out this query by first generating a full set of query results
(five rows) and then eliminating rows that are exact duplicates of one another to form the final query results.

*ANOTHER EXECUTION EXPLANATION

SELECT NAME, SALES
FROM SALESREPS
WHERE MANAGER = 104;

Conceptually, SQL goes through each row of the SALESREPS table, one by one, and applies the search condition to the row
When a column name appears in the search condition (such as the MANAGER
column in this example), SQL uses the value of the column in the current row. For each row,
the search condition can produce one of three results:

If the search condition is TRUE, the row is included in the query results.
incase of false or null values are excluded from the query
